<h1 align="center">Simple REST API for news</h1>

<h3>It's a simple API project for news ussing django rest framework with the default data base SQLite3</h3>

<h4>I used generics ListCreateAPIView to list all news and the ability to create a new ones.<br><br>
About the filtering and ordering - It's used generic filtering from DjangoFilterBackend and OrderingFilter from filters for the ordering. Also I have created another way to filter the news with custom overriding the queryset.
